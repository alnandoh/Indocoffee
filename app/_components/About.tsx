          We are Filbert and Richard from Semarang City. Since 2021, we have
          been exporting Indonesian commodities such as recycled plastics and
          charcoal briquettes to several countries. During our recent trip to
          Temanggung Regency, just a two-hour drive from our home, we discovered
          the exceptional quality of the local coffee. We were impressed not
          only by the superior quality of the coffee beans but also by the
          advanced post-harvest processing techniques, such as natural, dry, and
          wine processes, employed by the coffee growers. Inspired by this
          discovery, we decided to introduce these high-quality products to the
          global audience, so more people can enjoy the unique flavors of
          Indonesian coffee.
